Findings suggest quick reversion of cross-border prices to parity. Specifically the half-life of deviations is estimated to be 10.34 hours. With this evidence in mind, eBay appears ever closer to an Economist\u2019s ideal marketplace, with limited price friction, large numbers of informed buyers and sellers, and low barriers to entry.",

        "abstract": "Between 2002 and 2012, contributions by New York’s state and local governments to public employee retirement plans rose more than 500 percent, squeezing budgets for municipalities across the state. This surge was driven primarily by investment losses as well as the plan’s practice of adjusting government contributions to offset unexpected investment gains and losses. The plan benefit structure was not the culprit. Although current retirees from New York’s state and local governments receive more generous pensions than government employees in most states, recent cutbacks have significantly reduced pensions for new hires. Further benefit cuts do not seem warranted.",

An alternative approach would be to replace the existing traditional defined benefit plan with a cash balance plan, which combines features of 401(k)-type plans and traditional pensions. Our simulations show that 72 percent of Illinois public school teachers hired before 2011—and 56 percent of those with five or more years of completed service—would fare better in the simulated cash balance plan than the existing plan, even though the cash balance plan would be no more costly to taxpayers.",

Teachers who spend their entire careers in the plan receive large pensions. However, teachers who join the plan at relatively young ages and spend less than full careers in the classroom accumulate few retirement benefits, and those benefits are often worth less than the value of the teachers’ required plan contributions. As policymakers address the California teacher pension plan’s funding problems, they should consider altering the plan’s benefit formula to more equitably distribute pension benefits across the workforce.",

        "abstract": "The California State Teachers’ Retirement System has been grossly underfunded for the past decade. State policymakers have responded by cutting plan benefits for new hires and raising teachers’ required plan contributions. These changes, however, have undermined teachers’ retirement income security. Only 35 percent of new hires will receive pensions worth more than the value of their required plan contributions. Most new hires would have better financial outcomes if they could opt out of the mandatory retirement plan and invest their contributions elsewhere. Additional plan reforms should focus on changing the benefit formula to distribute pensions more equitably across the workforce.",

An equally important problem, though underappreciated, is that relatively few teachers benefit much from the plan.

Only 24 percent of those who complete at least five years of service receive pensions worth more than the value of their required plan contributions. Alternative plan designs, such as cash balance plans, could distribute benefits more equitably and put more teachers on a path to a financially secure retirement.",

Although controversial, the new hybrid plan will boost retirement incomes for most of the state\u2019s public school teachers. Our simulations show that two-thirds of newly hired teachers will earn more retirement benefits under the hybrid plan they would have earned under the old plan.

Employees who join the government payroll at relatively young ages and remain for no more than 25 years will accumulate more benefits in the cash balance plan than the traditional plan, while many of those with more years of service and hired at older ages will accumulate less. More than half of employees hired in 2014 who complete at least five years of service will fare better in the cash balance plan, which distributes benefits more evenly across the workforce.",

        "abstract": "Traditional defined benefit pension plans that cover nearly all state and local government employees generally penalize work at older ages. In more than three-fifths of state-administered plans, employees hired at age 25 will receive lower lifetime pension benefits if they continue working after age 57 because retirement-eligible workers cannot receive benefit checks while they remain on the job. This reduction in benefits can create strong retirement incentives, which are hard to justify as the population ages and health gains and declines in physical work enable more older people to work. Well-designed public pension reforms could eliminate these work disincentives.",

        "abstract": "Traditional defined benefit pension plans that cover nearly all state and local government employees generally provide generous retirement benefits to long-tenured public servants but little retirement security to those with shorter tenures. Virtually every plan requires employee contributions. In half of those plans, employees must work at least 20 years before their future benefits are worth more than those contributions. Employees who separate earlier get nothing from their plan. Alternative designs like cash balance plans distribute benefits more equally across the workforce and allow employees who spend less than a full career in public service to accumulate retirement benefits.",

The lifetime value of their pension surges when they qualify for early benefits. Our analysis shows that on average, half the benefits employees have accumulated by their early 50s or late 40s are earned from a single year of work. These patterns create strong incentives for mid-career workers to remain on the payroll until they realize these windfalls, including those ill-suited for their jobs.",
